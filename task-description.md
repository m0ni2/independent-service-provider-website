### Optional But Highly Recommended:
1. Your checkout page will be a dynamic route with route parameter having the id of the service user created. In the checkout page, you will have a simple form that you will have fields for user name, user email address, address, and phone number. Once the user submits the form, you will display the  user, `thank you for the booking.`
2. Use the Environment variable to hide the firebase key
3. Add active routes to see which route you are.
4. If possible, make the entire website responsive. Once you are done making the home page responsive, you wont need much things to do to make the entire website responsive. 





### What to submit: 
1. Your Github repository
2. Your live website link

### Some Guidelines:
1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 30 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once that is done, pick the next task. If you got stuck on one task, move on to the next task.
2. Stay calm, think and work sequentially. You will make it.
